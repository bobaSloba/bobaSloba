👋 Hi, I’m @bobaSloba — Slobodan Jevtić

I'm from Trstenik, Serbia — born on August 19, 2001, in Kraljevo.
Known locally as the “tech-savvy guy,” I’ve always been curious about how things work — especially computers.

👀 Interests
Throughout my life, my interests have shifted — from economics to gaming, from tech to creative work.
Two things have stuck with me: economics and programming.

I used to compete in programming when I was younger, but like many people, high school distracted me. Now, older and more self-aware, I've committed to coding again — this time for real. I want to build, create, and contribute.

🌱 Currently Learning
Python (habit-tracking app in Kivy)

JavaScript (starting frontend foundations)

Web development: HTML, CSS, and React next

💡 Personal Goals
Become a full-stack developer

Build tools that help people track habits, stay productive, and improve mental health

🤝 Open to Collaborations On
Web-based projects (frontend or backend)

Anything that helps me learn and contribute
